\chapter{Prelude:  Proof, Sets, and Linear Systems}

The purpose of this chapter is to give the briefest possible introduction to the tools we'll need to do linear algebra---namely proofs, sets, and linear systems.

\section{Proofs}

A proof is an argument meant to convince a mathematician of the truth of a claim. If we were to try to convince a computer of the truth of a mathematical claim, we would have to be absolutely rigid and precise in our language, using only mathematical symbols.  In writing a convincing argument to a human, however, we should make judicious use of English sentences to tie our mathematical ideas together. 

The simplest kind of proof is a \textbf{direct proof}. Suppose we want to show ``If $A$, then $Z$''.
